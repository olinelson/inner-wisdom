                <p>Many people seek help from a Psychologist, knowing there is a particular concern they want to address, but donâ€™t know how to make the changes they desire.</p>
                <p>Others experience on going distress in their lives or relationships and are looking for personal growth, support and guidance.</p>
                <p>Many have suffered abuse, trauma or grief and would like to make sense of their experiences, seek healing and build strategies to empower them to live more fulfilling lives.</p>

            </Quote>
                <p>For those seeking couples counselling, their relationships are often a source of stress and emotional pain, due to differing values and goals, a sense of betrayal or unhelpful communication patterns.</p>

                <p>Deciding what you want to achieve from your sessions and clarifying expectations is an important part of the counselling process.</p>
